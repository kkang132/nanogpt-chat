# RL Chat System Implementation Plan

## Overview
Transform the current supervised learning chat system into a reinforcement learning system that can learn from user feedback and improve response quality over time.

## Current State
- **Base**: GPT-2 fine-tuned on conversational data
- **Training**: Supervised learning with cross-entropy loss
- **Data**: Human-assistant conversation pairs
- **Interface**: Flask web server with chat UI

## Target Architecture

### 1. Reward Model Component
- **Purpose**: Score response quality based on user feedback
- **Input**: User message, generated response, user rating/feedback
- **Output**: Reward signal (0-1 scale)
- **Implementation**: 
  - Simple rating system (thumbs up/down)
  - More sophisticated: multi-criteria scoring (relevance, helpfulness, safety)
  - Future: learned reward model from human preferences

### 2. RL Training Loop
- **Algorithm**: PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)
- **Policy**: Current GPT model (actor)
- **Value Function**: Separate critic network
- **Environment**: Chat interface with reward feedback
- **State**: Conversation history + current user message
- **Action**: Next token generation
- **Reward**: From reward model

### 3. Environment Interface
- **State Space**: Tokenized conversation history
- **Action Space**: Vocabulary of possible next tokens
- **Reward Function**: Combination of immediate and delayed rewards
- **Episode**: Complete conversation session

## Implementation Phases

### Key Classes

#### ChatEnvironment
```python
class ChatEnvironment(gym.Env):
    def __init__(self, model, tokenizer, max_length=512):
        # Initialize chat environment
    
    def reset(self):
        # Start new conversation
    
    def step(self, action):
        # Generate response, get reward, return next state
    
    def render(self):
        # Display current conversation
```

#### RewardModel
```python
class RewardModel:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize reward scoring
    
    def score_response(self, user_msg, response, feedback=None):
        # Return reward signal
    
    def update_from_feedback(self, feedback_data):
        # Learn from user feedback
```

#### PPOTrainer
```python
class PPOTrainer:
    def __init__(self, policy_net, value_net, env):
        # Initialize PPO trainer
    
    def collect_rollouts(self, n_steps):
        # Collect experience data
    
    def update_policy(self, rollouts):
        # Update policy using PPO
    
    def train(self, total_timesteps):
        # Main training loop
```

## Development Workflow

### Git Strategy
1. **Main branch**: Keep current supervised learning system
2. **Feature branches**: Each phase gets its own branch
3. **PRs**: Small, focused pull requests for each component
4. **Testing**: Each PR requires tests and documentation
